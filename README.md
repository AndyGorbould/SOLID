# SOLID


# S

    should have a single responsibility & do it well

# O
Open/Closed principle
    closed for modification but open for extension

# L
Liskov substitution principle
    interfaces shouldn't work about which class they are implemented to

# I

    think ahead to avoid too many properties or functions being in each class or interface

# D
Dependency inversion principle
    stop class/class dependency, allow boarder terms to increase expandability
